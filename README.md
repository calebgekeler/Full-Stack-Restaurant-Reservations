# Full-Stack Restaurant Reservation System
## [Prod build frontend](https://front-end-nine-alpha.vercel.app)
## [Pord build backend](https://back-end-wine.vercel.app/reservations?date=2021-05-05)

This app was designed for restaurant backends. It allows the user to create reservations and tables in a restaurant. Reservations can be:
- cancelled
- seated
- finished
- booked

Bootstrap was used for styling

Postgres was used for the database with Knex as the JS query builder.

API is built with Express and follows CRUD practices.

Authentication and authorization are coming soon!

Further TODOs can be found in issues.
