# Full-Stack Restaurant Reservation System
## [The full build!](https://front-end-nine-alpha.vercel.app)

This app was designed for restaurant backends. It allows the user to create reservations and tables in a restaurant. Reservations can be:
- cancelled
- seated
- finished
- booked

Bootstrap was used for styling.

### API

Postgres was used for the database with Knex as the JS query builder.

API is built with Express and follows CRUD practices.

### Coming Soon!

- Authentication and authorization.
- Improved Styling
- Further TODOs can be found in issues.
